## Web Clip Icons
  If you have a web app or a website, you can provide a custom icon that users can display on their Home screens using the web clip feature. Users tap the icon to reach your web content in one easy step. You can create an icon that represents your website as a whole or an icon that represents a single webpage.

  If your web content is distinguished by a familiar image or recognizable color scheme, it makes sense to incorporate it in your icon. However, to ensure that your icon looks great on the device, you should also follow the guidelines in this section. (To learn how to add code to your web content to provide a custom icon, see _[Safari Web Content Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002051.)_

  For iPhone and iPod touch, create icons that measure:

*   120 x 120 pixels

*   60 x 60 pixels (standard resolution)

  For iPad, create icons that measure:

*   144 x 144 pixels

*   72 x 72 pixels (standard resolution)

		Note
		You can prevent the addition of any effects by naming your icon `apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png`.
